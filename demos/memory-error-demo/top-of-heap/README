DEMO Sequence

1. Launch
   - `make`
   - `pwndbg demo`

2. Show heap
   - `start`

3. Next: void *a = malloc(9);
   - `n`
   - `vis`
   - `p a`
     note where `a` is allocated

4. Next: malloc(1);
   - `n`
   - `vis`
     note that the minimal chunc size is 24 bytes + 8 bytes of metadata

5. Next: malloc(0);
   - `n`
   - `vis`
     note that this will actually allocate a new chunk

6. Next: malloc(24);
   - `n`
   - `vis`
     maximize the heap chunk size

7. Next: malloc(25);
   - `n`
   - `vis`
     this will create a chunk of 40 bytes + 8 bytes of metadata

8. Next: free(a);
   - `n`
   - `vis`
     note that `a` is freed, and check what happens in the chunk

9. Next: void *b = malloc(9);
   - `n`
   - `vis`
     note where `b` is allocated, which should be exactly where `a` was previously allocated
   - `p b`
   - `p a`
     confirm that `b` and `a` are pointing to the same address
